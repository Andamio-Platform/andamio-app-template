# Design Proposal: {iteration_date}

## Context

**Feedback Source:** {link to feedback digest}
**Iteration:** {iteration_date}

## Executive Summary

{2-3 sentences summarizing the key problems and proposed solutions}

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: {problem_title}

**From Feedback:**
> {quote from feedback digest}

**Root Cause Analysis:**
{Why this problem exists - dig deeper than the symptom}

**Proposed Solution:**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Change | {what to change} |
| Rationale | {why this solution} |
| Files | {files to modify} |
| Components | {components affected} |

**Visual (if applicable):**
```
Before: [description or ASCII diagram]
After:  [description or ASCII diagram]
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. {alternative_1} - Rejected because {reason}
2. {alternative_2} - Rejected because {reason}

## Impact Assessment

| # | Problem | Solution | Impact | Effort | Risk |
|---|---------|----------|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | {problem} | {solution} | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | {risks} |
| 2 | {problem} | {solution} | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | {risks} |

## Dependencies

{Any solutions that depend on others being implemented first}

- Solution 2 requires Solution 1 to be completed first
- Solution 3 requires API changes (out of scope)

## Out of Scope

{Things explicitly not addressed in this proposal}

- {item_1}
- {item_2}

## Open Questions

{Questions that need answers before implementation}

1. {question_1}
2. {question_2}
