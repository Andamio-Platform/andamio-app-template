/**
 * SSE Transaction Stream Types
 *
 * Types for Server-Sent Events from the gateway TX stream endpoint.
 * The gateway sends three event types during a transaction's lifecycle:
 *
 * 1. `state` - Initial state when client connects (current snapshot)
 * 2. `state_change` - Real-time state transition notification
 * 3. `complete` - Terminal state reached (success or failure)
 *
 * @see src/hooks/tx/use-tx-stream.ts - Consumer hook
 * @see src/app/api/gateway-stream/[...path]/route.ts - SSE proxy
